Lowkey haven't seen something like this posted yet, I know there's some out there just don't know if it's gatekept or not because I've seen people ask for it. Did some re-search on google and didn't really find any either, so here's this made this for "The Chi Roleplay" supports ESX groups, the command and kick message is changeable via the config.lua. If the name isn't obvious already it's basically just something that will let a certain group or multiple groups change a players name via in-game the changes will be applied to the database, and drop the player for when the player re-connects their name has been changed.
